# Horiseon

## Description
With the code provided for this project I updated the html code to be semantic with a clean structure. I added alt attributes to every image in the html code provided. All headings fall in sequential order. The title element has been updated to reflect the site. I updated the code so that when clicking Search Engine Optimization in the nav bar it takes you to that section on the page. I reviewed and cleaned up the CSS sheet to be DRY and not repetative.
